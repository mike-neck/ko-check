== About

Ktcheck is the testing framework for Kotlin programing language with GWT(Given, When, Then) style.
The goal is to provide a definitive precondition(Given) and post-condition(Then) to the function under test.

Ktcheck can run on https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit Jupiter], and ktcheck provides the way to run standalone so that users can write a ktcheck test on any testing framework.
